The separable wavelet transform used in JPEG 2000 still suffers many of the sample limitations of DCT-based transforms. Although complex wavelet transforms allow sparse representations of singularities or oriented components, none have become popular for lossy compression.\n",

All values are represented as 32-bit floating point during training, so the convolutional layers increase the density of class related in"

    "## Approaches to integrating compression and learning\n",
    "\n",
    "A core challenge to learning from compressed data is that, in the conventional approach to DNN optimization, all input samples are represented using floating point. This approach was popularized because of the convenience and power of GPUs which provide high throughput 32-bit floating point computation. Although 16-bit float hardware is now widely available and 8-bit floating point standards are on the horizon, lowering the precision leads to significant issues representing gradients during optimization.\n",

    "Suppose that the inputs are 128x128 RGB Although the input size is much larger than the output, when properly trained, the amount of class information should be roughly the same. In other words, the function of the layers is to increase the information density of the class.\n",
